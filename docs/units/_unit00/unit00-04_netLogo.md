After we have familiarized ourselves with the understanding of sustainability and dealt with the system dynamic world model, it should now become even more "real". The system dynamic modeling lacks the space for this. Actors (people, animals, plants, etc.) act and interact in space. I have to stand in front of a tree to cut it down or a cow has to be in the pasture to graze on grass.
At the same time, it is very difficult to put into a mathematical equation the actions of a cow, for example, in relation to eating grass. Rather, it follows rules (e.g. "eat the juiciest grass within a meter and move on")

You should now use a simple NetLogo model to make statements about sustainable behavior.

### Agent-based modeling an interactive introduction
To start with, let's play a short game.

### The NetLogo modeling software
We need the software NetLogo. If NetLogo is not installed on your computer, you can download and install the free software in a suitable version for your operating system from the [download page](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.2.0/). This variant makes sense, especially if you want to browse and try out a little more than our workshop.

If you work with the local installation of NetLogo, please download the model file [nachnachhaltigesWirtschaften.nlogo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/scripts/sustainableFarming.nlogo){:target="_blank"} and save it a suitable place. Then you can open the model with NetLogo

If you don't feel like installing it or if there are problems with the download, you can also work with the online version embedded below. You can download and download the online mockup below to open with a local installation of NetLogo by clicking the "Export NetLogo" button.

### NetLogo Model Cooperation
You should use about 20 minutes here.
{: .notice--success}

The cooperation model and the adaptation both work according to the same basic rule:

* the cows eat grass in the field they are in and get energy from it
* if they have enough energy they reproduce
* if you don't have enough energy, you die
* They advance to a new grass field after each time step
* the grass grows back; half-grown grass faster than grass that has been completely eaten away

* There are sustainable cows (cooperative cows) and greedy cows (greedy cows)
* the cooperative cows only eat tall grass and eat up to half of it
* the greedy cows eat both tall and semi-tall grass

### Give it a try...
Now that you can use the model either here on the website or with the help of your local installation, it's exciting to try out a few things.

Try to answer the following questions by adjusting the settings of the model world using the sliders:

* how many sustainably raised cows can live on the pasture
* how many unsustainably farmed cows fit on the pasture
* which cows dominate in the short term and which cows dominate in the long term in mixed husbandry
* What do you think is the best result? Why?


## In the backpack...

The rules for using resources should be clearly defined and as simple as possible.
Rules must be accepted by the actors or the jointly defined usage goal must be achieved.
The development, acceptance and enforcement (sliders!) of rules are the basis of the collective use of resources.
So that we don't have to do any (probably irreversible) experiments on the real world, we can use special modeling software (NetLogo, Insightmaker...) to develop and test simplified models.
