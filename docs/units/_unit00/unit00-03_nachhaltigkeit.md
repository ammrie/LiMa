Now that we have established that the term involves a lot of theory and politics, we should remember that a concrete model triggered this discussion almost exactly 50 years ago.

You should need about 20 minutes for the *Sustainable World* unit.

So if you are interested in the scientific basis of sustainable development, you come to this "Ur-Studie* *[Limits to Growth](https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/) * of the [Club of Rome](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_of_Rome). It describes quantitatively and in a way that everyone can understand (and therefore also be open to discussion and criticism) specifically the sustainability problem first mentioned by Malthus on the basis of worldwide Mechanisms of action of these three pillars environment, economy and society.

As a basis for the report, Jay Forrester developed a mathematical **model**, the so-called *world model*, which describes the essential relationships and interactions using equations. In order to come to a concrete statement on this basis, all the data required and available at the time were fed in. Since this model was developed with the help of a computer, it can make predictions through simulations. Together with other scientists, his students Donella and Dennis Meadows then carried out their analyzes for the Limits to Growth report on this model.

## System dynamics - the world model 30 years later
The simulations were the starting point to quantitatively show the limits of growth without real-world experiments and thus once again to show the necessity of resource scarcity and sensible use of resources and to put them up for discussion.

Forrester had not only developed the world model, but also developed the concept of graphical dynamic modeling in cooperation with MIT colleagues. This is a clear simplification compared to conventional programming using graphic elements to which corresponding formulas and effects are assigned.

Since both the *world model* and such programming environments have been continuously developed, we can now fall back on a large number of software programs and *world models*. The best known is probably the *World 3 model* from 2008. Due to its "famousness" it is available in almost all system dynamics programming environments.

For a first brief introduction, the online programming environment *Insightmaker* can be used, which offers a great opportunity for performance in system dynamics.

You can view the [World 3 Model](https://insightmaker.com/insight/1954/The-World3-Model-Classic-World-Simulation), i.e. the current version of the original world model, online and with the help of the browser -supported software Insightmaker carry out own model scenarios (simulation).

### Give it a try...

* Find out when the turning point in the prosperity level is predicted
* to vary the reference period with the regulators
* Look at the model - what is your impression? How does it affect you?

## In the backpack...

Forrester's model is very complex and difficult to understand without intensive work and a great deal of specialist knowledge. However, despite the high level of complexity, the model is based on an extreme simplification of reality. The reason is simple:

Models are always purposeful simplifications.

When we model, we **always** focus on the factors and relationships that are important to our problem. We leave everything else out. This is the only way we can achieve results.
