Now that we have established that the term involves a lot of theory and politics,and got to know that a concrete model triggered this discussion almost exactly 50 years ago, we will explore the *world model*

You should need about 10 minutes for the *Sustainable World* unit.

For a first brief introduction, the online programming environment *Insightmaker* can be used, which offers a great opportunity for performance in system dynamics.

You can view the [World 3 Model](https://insightmaker.com/insight/1954/The-World3-Model-Classic-World-Simulation), i.e. the current version of the original world model, online and with the help of the browser -supported software Insightmaker carry out own model scenarios (simulation).

### Give it a try...

* Find out when the turning point in the prosperity level is predicted
* to vary the reference period with the regulators
* Look at the model - what is your impression? How does it affect you?

## In the backpack...

Forrester's model is very complex and difficult to understand without intensive work and a great deal of specialist knowledge. However, despite the high level of complexity, the model is based on an extreme simplification of reality. The reason is simple:

Models are always purposeful simplifications.

When we model, we **always** focus on the factors and relationships that are important to our problem. We leave everything else out. This is the only way we can achieve results.
