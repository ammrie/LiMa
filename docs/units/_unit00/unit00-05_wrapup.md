What do your insights from working with the models mean for the real world?
Can you make a connection to the youcoN's main theme of climate justice?

## idea
The model world should now be left and knowledge transferred to the real world. The best way to do this is without a doubt in discussion. Find another person or group to discuss with.

You should use about 20 minutes here.

### Think and discuss first...
* how the cow model explains the state we are in globally.
* Analogies (i.e. what fills the same role) between the model and climate justice.
* what forecast the model gives for our future.
* which behavior would be useful according to the model.

### Then discuss...
* which hurdles for climate justice we can derive from the model.
* what solutions are conceivable.

## In the backpack...

Here you will find a model that shows the current situation regarding climate change (optionally also Covid 19 or similar) in a simplified way. It is based on the T.D. Seeley's concept of [honeybee democracy](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dyer_Seeley). The author Mike Anderson describes the effect concepts of the model [*ClimateWise1_2*](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/ClimateWise1_2) in detail under the info tab.

I did the translation of some insertions and the adaptation to NetLogo 6.2.

If you are working with the local installation of NetLogo, please download the model file [ClimateWise1_2_germa.nlogo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/scripts/ClimateWise1_2_germa.nlogo){:target="_blank"} and save it to a suitable place. Then you can open the model with NetLogo.
