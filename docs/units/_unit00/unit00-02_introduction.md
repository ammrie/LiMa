Here we go!
Before we get into the *modeling of sustainability*, we should clarify what it is all about first.
<!--more-->


### Today's understanding of sustainability
The global *"modern concept"* of sustainability roots in the 1970s. In the [Club of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Club_of_Rome) a *"sustainable world system"* is demanded, which is the first modern appearance of the term, which is being taken up rapidly: e.g. the World Council of Churches Commission for 1974 formulates the idea of a *"sustainable society"* and the first Green Party (in Great Britain) which passed its *"Manifesto for a Sustainable Society"* in 1975. However, it took until 1987 when the *World Commission on Environment and Development*, the so-called [Brundtland Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brundtland-Report) published its report that *defined "sustainable development"* as:

  *"[...] a development that satisfies the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"*

This report triggers a worldwide discussion that finally leads to the *"Rio Earth Summit"* in 1992.
Sensationally, 114 heads of state and countless non-governmental organizations met and agreed in the "Rio Declaration" on the principle of sustainable development - known to this day as *"Agenda 21"*.

Today, this *sustainable development* is usually understood as an interacting process between the *three pillars* environment, economy and society - at the same time as an image for the necessary and differently weighted compromises between (apparently) equally desirable goals.

## From gray theory to concrete application

Now that we have established that the term involves a lot of theory and politics, we should remember that a concrete model triggered this discussion almost exactly 50 years ago.

So if you are interested in the scientific basis of sustainable development, you come to this "Ur-Studie" *[Limits to Growth](https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/) * of the [Club of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_of_Rome) It describes quantitatively and in a way that everyone can understand (and therefore also be open to discussion and criticism) specifically the sustainability problem first mentioned by Malthus on the basis of worldwide Mechanisms of action of these three pillars environment, economy and society.

As a basis for the report, Jay Forrester developed a mathematical **model**, the so-called *world model*, which describes the essential relationships and interactions using equations. In order to come to a concrete statement on this basis, all the data required and available at the time were fed in. Since this model was developed with the help of a computer, it can make predictions through simulations. Together with other scientists, his students Donella and Dennis Meadows then carried out their analyzes for the Limits to Growth report on this model.

## System dynamics - the world model 30 years later
The simulations were the starting point to quantitatively show the limits of growth without real-world experiments and thus once again to show the necessity of resource scarcity and sensible use of resources and to put them up for discussion.

Forrester had not only developed the world model but also developed the concept of graphical dynamic modeling in cooperation with MIT colleagues. This is a clear simplification compared to conventional programming using graphic elements to which corresponding formulas and effects are assigned.

Since both the *world model* and such programming environments have been continuously developed, we can now fall back on a large number of software programs and *world models*. The best known is probably the *World 3 model* from 2008. Due to its "famousness" it is available in almost all system dynamics programming environments.
